# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This Project was made to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as to farmiliarize myself with the basics of Git commands in a CLI. In addition, this project contains some basic notes I took during the prework section of the class I am taking, which are free for the user to take advantage of.

If you wish to see the JavaScript in action, use the browser's developer tools to open the console tab.
